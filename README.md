# AegisHunt

**Design and Implementation of an Autonomous Threat Hunting System Using Machine Learning**

AegisHunt is a defensive research prototype that will turn network-flow and
structured security telemetry into explainable detections, correlated alerts,
investigation hypotheses, and analyst-managed cases. It is intended to
demonstrate a complete threat-hunting lifecycle rather than only a classifier.

## Project goals

- Detect known malicious behavior with supervised learning.
- Identify behavior that departs from a benign baseline with anomaly detection.
- Fuse independent signals without presenting risk scores as attack probabilities.
- Correlate evidence and generate deterministic, reviewable hunt hypotheses.
- Preserve analyst control over verdicts, retraining, and model activation.
- Produce a runnable, testable, reproducible master's-project prototype.

## Current status

Phase 0 foundation is implemented on `phase/00-foundation`. The repository
currently provides an installable Python package, CLI shell, FastAPI health
endpoint, Streamlit status page, engineering controls, and architecture and
requirements documentation. Telemetry ingestion, storage, features, detection,
models, alerts, hypotheses, and cases are planned and are **not implemented**.

## Planned architecture

The system is a modular monolith with a FastAPI backend, Streamlit frontend,
Typer CLI, lightweight background processing, SQLite default storage, and a
scikit-learn dual detection engine. The core remains usable without an LLM,
live capture, root privileges, or a fixed network target. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and the ADRs in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## Local development installation

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

`pyproject.toml` is the dependency source of truth; no compatibility
`requirements.txt` is maintained in Phase 0.

## Current commands

```bash
aegishunt --help
aegishunt doctor
aegishunt api
aegishunt frontend
```

`doctor` checks Python compatibility, the operating system, and required local
directories. Only the commands above exist in Phase 0.

## Start the API

```bash
aegishunt api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Interactive OpenAPI documentation is available at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` while the API is running.

## Start Streamlit

```bash
aegishunt frontend --address 127.0.0.1 --port 8501
```

The Phase 0 page reports foundation status and planned modules only. It does
not display invented flows, alerts, hypotheses, or model metrics.

## Quality checks

```bash
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest
```

The test command produces terminal coverage output and `coverage.xml`.

## Roadmap overview

| Phases | Planned outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Requirements, ADRs, engineering foundation, CLI/API/frontend shells |
| 1-4 | Configuration, storage, telemetry, flows, features, and dataset quality |
| 5-7 | Supervised, anomaly, and fusion experiments |
| 8-10 | Explainable alerts, correlation, hypotheses, cases, and feedback |
| 11-12 | Runtime replay, API, and complete frontend demonstration |
| 13-14 | Hardening, performance, deployment, documentation, and final delivery |

Only one declared phase is developed at a time. Progress is tracked in
[`docs/codex_progress.md`](docs/codex_progress.md).

## Research-prototype disclaimer

AegisHunt is not a production security product and must not be treated as an
authoritative attack-confirmation or automated-response system. It does not
perform unauthorized scanning, exploitation, credential attacks, unrestricted
flooding, arbitrary command execution, firewall changes, or account disabling.
Future detections and hypotheses will remain evidence-backed suggestions for
human investigation.
